The Custom Invites Services provides a method of integrating existing invite systems with the invite functionality of the EOS Social Overlay. Calling the SetCustomInvite method of the Custom Invites Interface with a custom payload will enable the invite functionality in the friends list, at which point invites can be sent through the overlay or with the SendCustomInvite method of the Custom Invites Interface. Clients can use the Custom Invites Interface to receive and respond to custom invites, which are accompanied by the custom payload set by the sender. Those clients can then use custom behavior to handle the received payload and accept or reject the invite.
